# Reading list
This is a list of recommended reading for understanding the domain our language will be used in. They are meant to be read in order.

Most of the links are to the same page, the Ethereum white paper. Since it lacks numbered sections, we chose to link directly to the relevant parts. In other words, in these cases it is only necessary to read from the linked position to the next heading; the next section is relevant iff it is linked to from here, including sub-sections.

## Blockchain basics
These articles explain what blockchains are through a real-world example: Bitcoin, which was in fact the first example of a blockchain.
* https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf (sections 1-5, 9)
* https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper#bitcoin-as-a-state-transition-system

## Evolving blockchain tech
These sections explain how blockchain tech can be useful in domains other than money.
* https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper#alternative-blockchain-applications
* https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper#scripting

## Ethereum
Here we take a closer look at some of the technical details of Ethereum, the generalized and Turing-complete blockchain for which we intend to implement a programming language.

* https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper#ethereum-accounts
* https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper#messages-and-transactions
* https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper#messages

## Potential applications
As a bit of an optional aside, this section gives examples of applications that could be implemented on Ethereum, and as such, hopefully also in our programming language.
* https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper#applications (This is an exception to what was said before: all sub-sections are relevant. Thus, read until you reach the heading "Miscellanea And Concerns".)
