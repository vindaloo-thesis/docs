* Mandatory writing seminar.
* Read through the relevant sections of Ekblad's master's thesis.
  * It is not clear whether Core or STG is the optimal language to use as a basis for the code generation. (Ekblad chose Core.) Core is lazy, which is hard to implement, but on the other hand STG might be too low-level. We will probably have to study Core, STG and LLL/EVM more closely to identify the better choice.
  *  We don't yet understand Ekblad's distinction between different function applications, and whether this is relevant for us.
  * Good specification of the project, metrics of success and limitations. Everything is not directly relevant but there is a lot of inspiration to be gathered for sure.
  * Do we need an RTS as well?
  * Some of the problems noted in Ekblad's thesis probably carries over to our work and should be considered during decision making:
    * GHC's assumptions on the machine running the final code
    * Redundant low-level operations; many operations already exist in the target language
