* Found out that GHC's QuasiQuotation-extension could be used to give users of an EDSL a reasonable syntax (instead of using TemplateHaskell). However, this would include writing our own parser for the language.
* Found out that Anton Ekblad, PhD-student at Chalmers, took the same approach as we're leaning towards in his master's thesis (using the GHC API and then implementing code generation), where he compiled Haskell to JavaScript. We should have a lot of insights to gain from studying his work.
