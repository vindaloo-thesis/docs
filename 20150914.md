* Continued investigating EDSL-approach. In order to give users decent syntax for e.g. function definition, we will have to use Template Haskell to transform the AST:s of Haskell-expressions into our representation of the EDSL, which can then be translated to a target language. *Or* we could just use TH to go Haskell -> target language.
* Compiled approach seems more promising, since GHC Core is a much smaller language than Haskell, so it should be easier to translate into almost any target language.
