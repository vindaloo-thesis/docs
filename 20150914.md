* Continued investigating EDSL-approach. In order to give users decent syntax for e.g. function definition, we will have to use Template Haskell to transform the AST:s of Haskell-expressions into our representation of the EDSL, which can then be translated to a target language. *Or* we could just use TH to go Haskell -> target language.
* Compiled approach seems more promising, since GHC Core is a much smaller language than Haskell, so it should be easier to translate into almost any target language.
* Continued looking into GHC and extcore for compilation. GHC has removed support for dumping core files in more recent versions - currently using version 7.6.3 for compatability. Set up Dockerfile based on GHC Dev machine (with GHC changed from 7.8.3 to 7.6.3), which compiles GHC fine. Found a Core-to-JS project in early stages called glomm that we survey for inspiration. Some work with setting up environment and dependencies. Got 7 out of 13 tests running - strings not working.
