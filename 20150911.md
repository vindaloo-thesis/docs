* Set up project web page, trello board, calendar etc.
* decided to focus on Haskell as a base for the language
* Started parallell minimal implementation of EDSL and compiler.
* Investigated compiler approach. We will not write our own parser/lexer from scratch. Currently investigating the GHC API and toolchain. The road from Haskell source to binary looks roughly like follows:

[Parse tree] -Desugar-> [Core] -STGify-> [STG] -CodeGen-> C-- -Backend-> [LLVM/C/Native code]

Core is a minimal reduced representatino of the Haskell source based on System FC (an extended typed lambda calculus).
STG (Spineless Tagless G-machine) is a functional, low-level language that work directly with an internal representation of a stack, a heap and registers. 
C-- is a portable assembly language.

Since Haskell has a lot of syntactic sugar and other high-level constructs, it would be beneficial to work with something more minimal. C-- and STG are both a bit too close to machine code to be compiled to LLL. Using the GHC API to compile to Core and then trnsform that to LLL seems like the best alternative if we are to take the compiler approach. We spent some time reading up on GHC, STG and Core and the native code generation, as well as trying to get some code to run. Thee is a library called extcore for working with Core files - unfortunately it doesnâ€™t compile with the most recent stable version of GHC. We will try to see if we can get this working.
